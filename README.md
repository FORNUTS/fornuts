## About
This is a project for our CS 472 class Senior Capstone II, Spring 2013.

## FORNUTS
Simulates the carbon and nitrogen cycles in a forest ecology.

## Goal
Our goal is to take the old FORTRAN FORNUTS program and re-create the software so that it can run on more modern systems. We will also create a easy to use GUI with some statistical graphs based off the data for the client.

## To Download
We have versions for Mac/Windows/Linux avaliable to download.
